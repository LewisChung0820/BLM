	<h2> Examples: </h2>



			<h3> 13 March 2020: Breonna Taylor </h3>


		<img src="taylor.jpeg" width="470" height="460">



			<p><span class="text-bold">Breonna Taylor</span>, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, <span class="text-bold"> was shot eight times when officers raided her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky.</span></p>
			
			<p class="myp">Louisville police said they returned fire after one officer was shot at and wounded.</p>

			<p> Breonna Taylor's family filed a lawsuit, and in September 2020 reached a settlement of $12m (Â£9.4m) with the city authorities. </p>

			<p> The lawsuit stated that Ms Taylor's partner - who was with her at the time - had fired in self-defence because the police did not identify themselves, and he thought the apartment was being burgled.

		<h3> 25 May 2020: George Floyd </h3>
		
	<img src="floyd.jpeg" width="650" height="430">

		

		<p> <span class="text-bold">George Floyd</span> died after being arrested in Minneapolis and held down by police officers, one of whom <span class="text-bold"> had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.</span></p>

		<p class="myp"> He pleaded that he couldn't breathe, and after his death, protests broke out across the US, and there were demonstrations in other parts of the world. </p>

		<p>Former police officer Derek Chauvin - who had knelt on Mr Floyd - was convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after a three-week trial.</p>

		<p>Three other officers who were involved in the incident will be tried later this year accused of aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin.</p>
